# Property Testing Examples

I'm getting used to property testing, so I want to have some examples that work in C#, the language I use for a lot of projects with my teammates, so I can share.

# How it started

I had a collegue who was curious about using property testing in Unity for their side project, so I got some examples working in C# to 'Proof of Concept' the idea for them.

# How it's going

I'm putting this on GitHub so I can share out with more of my CoWorkers at a lightning talk.

# Plans?

I might add more examples as I come up with them and explore further.
